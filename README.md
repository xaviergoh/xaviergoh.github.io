PERSONAL STATEMENT

An ambitious and dedicated individual, seeking an internship experience in the

PERSONAL DETAILS

I am inquisitive and am generally interested in most things (academic or otherwise). I am usually
optimistic and open minded. I believe that change is important and will adapt to situations where
necessary. I am currently the Director of Clubs & Societies of RC4’s College Student Committee (CSC).
Aside from supporting college operations and helping to shape the college culture, I am also
responsible for all Interest Group (IG) related matters as well as the development and
maintenance of college facilities. I am currently also the Head/Captain of the college’s Table Tennis Interest Group and I have
been overseeing training and sustainability matters since last year.

HOBBIES & INTERESTS

Although Engineering provides me with a hands-on experience that allows me to explore my
creative freedom, I also find Philosophy intellectually stimulating and am interested to learn
more about the disciplines of Psychology and Rhetoric. I would also keep myself active by participating in various activities like sports and have also recently picked up dance. I am also keen on learning music and picking up languages and have attempted to pick up Piano and Japanese during my spare time. I also take immense joy in helping people and would occasionally volunteer, although I admit that I have not been
proactively seeking out such opportunities.
These are the ways I attempt to develop myself holistically in pursuit of self-actualisation.
